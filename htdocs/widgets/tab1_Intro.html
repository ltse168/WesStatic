          The Final Register of Electors for Rural Representative Election is
          published in October every year. If you are eligible for registration

          form reaches the Home Affairs Department (HAD)/Electoral Registration
          Officer (ERO) after 16 July of this year, information provided therein
          will be processed when the provisional registers of the following year
          are compiled.
